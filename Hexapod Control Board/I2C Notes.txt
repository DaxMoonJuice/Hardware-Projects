D1--Data Pin (SDA)----GPIO5
D2--Clock Pin (SCL)---GPIO4


When i2c var called as 

master.i2c.readfrom()

It works

and subsequent

master.readFromBus() calls work


Yet when master.readFromBus() called directly

It now works?

WTF!

process for it working

import robot
master=robot.masterI2C()
master.readFromBus(8,6)



Sensor Addresses

Accelerometer --ADXl345 Address is 83


Magnometer --0x1E --30
